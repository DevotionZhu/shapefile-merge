# Shapefile Merger

Quick and dirty script for mergeing lots of shapefiles into one using Fiona.

Paste the file into a directory containing all of the shapefiles and run it, results will be saved to `merge-output/merged.shp`. 

The output file will contain nothing but the geometries and the filepath from which each geometry originated.
